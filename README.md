# Black Jack


![Milestone Project 2](Blackjack-values.png)


## Project Goals
* You need to create a simple text-based [BlackJack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) game
* The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
* The player can stand or hit.
* The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
* You need to keep track of the player's total money.
* You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...

And most importantly:

* **You must use OOP and classes in some portion of your game. You can not just use functions in your game. Use classes to help you define the Deck and the Player's hand. There are many right ways to do this, so explore it well!**


Feel free to expand this game. Try including multiple players. Try adding in Double-Down and card splits! Remember to you are free to use any resources you want


### Rules of the Game
To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:
1. Create a deck of 52 cards
2. Shuffle the deck
3. Ask the Player for their bet
4. Make sure that the Player's bet does not exceed their available chips
5. Deal two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player
6. Show only one of the Dealer's cards, the other remains hidden
7. Show both of the Player's cards
8. Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card
9. If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.
10. If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17
11. Determine the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly
12. Ask the Player if they'd like to play again
